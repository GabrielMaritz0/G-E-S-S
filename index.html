      <h1>How Does Solar Work on the Grid?</h1>
      <p>One of the questions we get a lot is, well, where do the batteries go? In a modern system, most of the time there aren’t any. The way that is works: you’ve got your sun, you’ve got your house, and you’ve got your solar. Couple pieces of equipment that make this whole thing work: you’ve got an inverter, you’ve got your meter, and you have the electrical grid. So the suns going to hit the panels and create direct current electricity. That direct current is going to run to an inverter. The inverter switches it from DC to AC (alternating current) which is what we use in our house.
        When you’re producing more power than you’re able to use, that excess is going to get flushed out through the grid and it’s going to be stored there as a form of kilowatt hour bank, an electricity savings account if you will.
        When you’re not producing as much as you’re using, during the night or in the middle of winter, you’re going to pull from the grid again. Our goal is to get you to a point where the energy that’s going out equals the cost of the energy that’s coming in, and thus, zero’s out your energy bill.</p>
